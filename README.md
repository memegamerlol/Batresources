- **[Commands Reference](docs/commands_reference.md)** - Complete command documentation
- **[Best Practices](docs/best_practices.md)** - Tips for writing better batch files

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download** any example file from the repository
2. **Open** it in a text editor to see the code
3. **Double-click** the file to run it (or run it from Command Prompt)
4. **Modify** the code and experiment!

## 📖 Learning Path

1. Start with [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md)
2. Try the [Basic Examples](examples/basic/)
3. Move to [Intermediate Examples](examples/intermediate/)
4. Challenge yourself with [Advanced Examples](examples/advanced/)
5. Reference the [Commands Guide](docs/commands_reference.md) as needed
6. Follow [Best Practices](docs/best_practices.md) for production scripts

## 💡 Usage Tips

- Always start scripts with `@echo off` for cleaner output
- Use `pause` at the end to see results before window closes
- Test scripts in a safe directory first
- Read the comments in each example to understand the code

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Windows operating system (XP or later)
- Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
- Basic understanding of command line interface (helpful but not required)

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new examples
- Improving documentation
- Reporting issues

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Some utilities (like cleanup.bat) may require administrator privileges
- Always review scripts before running them, especially those that delete files
- Backup important data before running file manipulation scripts
- Test scripts in a safe environment first
